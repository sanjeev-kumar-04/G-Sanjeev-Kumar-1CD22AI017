## Platform
The codes are meant to be run **only in Google Colab**.

## Topic 1: Binary Image Classification

In this topic, I modified the  image classification code to work with a different dataset while keeping the same model structure and logic.

## Dataset Used
I used the **Malaria dataset from TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS)**, which contains two classes:
- Parasitized
- Uninfected

This dataset is directly available in Colab and does not require manual downloading or extraction.

## What I Changed
- I changed only the **dataset source**
- I kept the **CNN architecture the same**
- I did not use any advanced techniques or extra libraries

## How to Run
1. Open Google Colab  
2. Paste the full code into a single cell  
3. Run the cell from top to bottom  

No local setup is required.

## Output
- Training and validation accuracy
- Training and validation loss
- Prediction on a sample image
- Feature map visualization of CNN layers
